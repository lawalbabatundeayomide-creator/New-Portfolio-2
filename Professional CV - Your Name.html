    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
       Results-driven Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience in building, scaling, and maintaining high-performance web applications. My technical expertise spans the entire development lifecycle, with a primary focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. I am deeply passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and implementing user-centric designs that bridge the gap between complex backend logic and intuitive frontend experiences.</p>
       <p>
       Scaling, and maintaining high-performance web applications Throughout my career, I have successfully architected robust RESTful APIs and managed real-time data persistence for various digital platforms. My recent work on the AY'SHOES COLLECTION e-commerce project demonstrates my proficiency in building secure, end-to-end solutions, including the integration of OTP (One-Time Password) verification systems and secure authentication layers. I thrive in agile environments where performance optimization is a priority, consistently striving to deliver digital products that are technologically superior, secure, and impactful for the end-user.
